This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project that displays 'tweets' from users. This was basically a task to fully learn how the t3 stack works.

## Notes

- Prisma and planetscale for the db
- Clerk for auth
- Next.js for frontend
- Upstash for rate limiting
- Vercel for deployment

### DB (Planetscale)

```bash
npx prisma studio // Open prisma studio
npx prisma db push // push current schema
```
